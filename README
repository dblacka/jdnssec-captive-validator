DNSSECValTool
-------------

This is a command line Java tool for doing DNSSEC response
validatation against a single authoritative DNS server.

usage: java -jar dnssecvaltool.jar [..options..]
       server:       the DNS server to query.
       query:        a name [type [flags]] string.
       query_file:   a list of queries, one query per line.
       count:        send up to'count' queries, then stop.
       dnskey_file:  a file containing DNSKEY RRs to trust.
       dnskey_query: query 'server' for DNSKEY at given name to trust,
                     may repeat
       error_file:   write DNSSEC validation failure details to this file

The DNSSECValTool needs a server to query ('server'), a query or list
of queries ('query' or 'query_file'), and a set of DNSKEYs to trust
('dnskey_file' or 'dnskey_query') -- these keys MUST be the ones used
to sign everything in the responses.

By default it logs everything to stdout.  DNSSEC validation errors
(which is most of the output) can be redirected to a file (which will
be appended to if it already exists).

Note that the DNSSECValTool will skip queries if the qname isn't a
subdomain (or matches) the names of the DNSKEYs that have been added.

query_file
----------

This is a file of one query per line, with a query formatted as:

  qname [qtype] [qclass] [flags]

For example:

  pietbarber.com ns +ad
  blacka.com a IN +do
  verisign.com

The DO bit is redundant since all queries will be made with the DO bit
set.

Note: at the moment, flags are ignored.

dnskey_file
-----------

The is a list of DNSKEYs in zone file format.  It will ignore zone
file comments and non-DNSKEY records, so you can just use dig output:

   dig @0 edu dnskey +dnssec > keys
   dig @0 net dnskey +dnssec >> keys

dnskey_query
------------

For each one of these, do a DNSKEY query to the server for that name,
and add the resultant keys to the set of trusted keys.

Generating Queries
------------------

The query files are basically the same as those used by the
dnsreconciler tool, so similar techniques can be used to query names
out of ISFs, etc.  Here is a little perl code that will generate
queries for domain.tld, domain_.tld, and nameserver.tld for "EDU"
only:

#! /usr/bin/perl

while (<>) {
    # parse domain table lines
    /^i A / && do {
	@fields = split();
	$dn = $fields[3];
	($dom, $tld) = split(/\./, $dn, 2);
	next if $tld ne "EDU";
	print "$dn. A\n";
	print "${dom}_.$tld. A\n";
    };
    # parse nameserver table lines
    /^i B / && do {
	@fields = split();
	$ns = $fields[3];
	print "$ns. A\n";
    };
}

Examples
--------

1. Query "a.edu-servers.net", fetching the .edu keys directly from
   that server.  Use queries.txt for the queries, and log all DNSSEC
   validation failures to 'dnssecvaltool_errors.log'.

java -jar dnssecvaltool.jar server=a.edu-servers.net \
     dnskey_query=edu \
     query_file=queries.txt \
     error_file=dnssecvaltool_errors.log 

2. Query localhost with a single query for edu/soa, using stored keys
   in the file 'keys'.  Validation failures will be logged to stdout.

java -jar dnssecvaltool.jar server=127.0.0.1 \
     dnskey_file=keys \
     query="edu soa"

     
Important Note on Incompatible Java Versions
--------------------------------------------

As with any other jar file, if this jar file is created (e.g. using 'ant jar' or 'ant dist')
using a later Java version (e.g. 8) than the one with which it is ultimately run (e.g. 6),
then you may encounter a runtime error such as this one:

```
      java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError:
com/verisign/tat/dnssec/CaptiveValidator : Unsupported major.minor version
52.0 (RuntimeError)
```

The solution to this is to specify the target Java version when you build the jar file.
This can be done on the command line with the *ant.build.javac.target* property.
For example:

```
ant -Dant.build.javac.target=1.6 clean jar
```

The *clean* task is added to the command line above to guarantee that the Java source
files are actually compiled; without it the jar task will use whatever compiled
class files are already there.

In general, you should probably specify the target value to be the lowest Java version
you intend to use.
